# Notes

## To Do

- [ ] Review how to use `K` when on neovim man page
- [ ] Neovim `initial_mode = "normal"` does not work for extensions git_diffs
- [ ] [Show appropriate documentation](https://github.com/Saecki/crates.nvim/wiki/Documentation-v0.4.0#show-appropriate-documentation-in-cargotoml) in `cargo.toml`
- [ ] Telescope live grep to wrap lines. Check if plugin can do this, otherwise see [telescope.nvim documentation](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim#previewers)
- [ ] Based on the [nvm](./README.md#nvm) , could we rebuild automatically if the npm package is not found?
- [ ] Add keymap to toggle image preview
- [ ] lspsaga does float terminal : <https://nvimdev.github.io/lspsaga/floaterm/> and `snacks.nvim` too
- [ ] lspsaga hover cannot open links
- [ ] Should we keep using noice if we use snacks notifier
- [ ] Finish using snacks toggle
- [ ] Alt keymap does not work
- [ ] Migrate dev-web-icon to mini.icon
- [ ] Find how to open a commit from the blamed line
